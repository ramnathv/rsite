## R Site

My efforts at creating a clean, modern website for R using Bootstrap3 and Slidify.

#### How to Contribute

Every page on the site has an `Edit Me` button located at the bottom right of the page. Clicking on it will take you to http://prose.io, an online editor for github pages. You can make your edit and submit a pull-request.

If you have suggestions on what to include in the site, [click here](https://github.com/ramnathv/rsite/issues/new) and post your suggestions.
